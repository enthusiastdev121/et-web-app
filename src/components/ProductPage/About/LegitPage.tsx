          Is Explore Talent legit?
        </h1>

        <Paper>
          <p>
            Since 2003, Explore Talent has been helping aspiring talents and
            models reach their goal to become part of the entertainment and
            fashion industries. Despite the company&apos;s good intentions,{" "}

              <a target="_blank">internet trolls</a>
            </Link>{" "}
            who expects to have everything on the internet for free have
            surfaced online saying that Explore Talent is a scam. They are
            questioning not just the site&apos;s credibility, but also the
            reliability of the auditions and casting calls they provide daily.
            These people who expect to have something-for-nothing have even gone
            as far as to say that the company is a complete fraud, provoking
            readers into an emotional response. These people say things like
            &ldquo;never pay for auditions&rdquo;, are expecting the hundreds of
            people operating Explore Talent to work for free. We are also aware
            of few competitors who are regularly posting fake negative comments
            and complaints on review sites.
          </p>

          <h2>Explore Talent Remains Strong Despite Harsh Criticisms</h2>

          <p>
            However, the legitimacy of Explore Talent cannot just unfairly be
            tarnished by the barrage of complaints and negative criticisms
            spread over the Internet while ignoring the thousands of satisfied
            customers. Its growth still continues with its escalating number of
            members, which is now at over 10 million. It is also going strong in
            its effort to provide more casting calls, auditions and jobs.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a holder of an accredited business from the Better Business
            Bureau, its standing in the business of making aspiring talent
            successful is as solid as ever. This sterling rating is backed by a
            huge database of auditions, casting calls and jobs that are 10 times
            more than any other talent resource sites, making Explore Talent the
            largest of its kind. The services and value they offer have paved
            the way for its members to land thousands of jobs and auditions in
            both fashion and entertainment fields.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the site&apos;s BBB rating, its length of service in the
            industry and its{" "}

              <a>massive listing of casting calls</a>
            </Link>
            , auditions and jobs, you can decide for yourself if Explore Talent
            is legit or not. If you will read through the testimonials and
            success stories posted by its members online, you can already figure
            out that all the harsh and negative criticisms against the site are
            nothing but part of a smear campaign intended to place the
            company&apos;s excellent standing and name in a bad light.

              </h3>

              <p>
                I had been with LA Casting for 9 months. After submitting for
                auditions and getting nothing, I decided to give Explore Talent
                a try. Within two weeks of becoming a member of Explore Talent,
                I started going on 2-3 auditions per week. I have now been with
                ExploreTalent.com for 6 months and I have not stopped working. I
                never even got any auditions on LACasting.com and everything
                changed after I joined ExploreTalent.com.

                I started on Explore Talent in March and immediately found my
                first audition for a voice over part. When I went for the
                audition, I didn&apos;t get the voice over...because they cast
                me for a supporting role. Next I self submitted to audition for
                a supporting role in a movie about a NY Crime Family Boss. I
                didn&apos;t get that part either...because they cast me as the
                LEAD!! Then I self submitted for a supporting role in another
                film and got that one. Yes, there have been others that I have
                submitted for but have either not gotten the call or had to turn
                down the audition due to conflicts (but that is a great feeling,
                when you can&apos;t do it- BECAUSE YOU ARE WORKING!!!) While
                these haven&apos;t been paid gigs, my resume has gone from
                basically nothing for the last 30 years to a nicely rounded
                experience grouping. As a result I now have 2 SAG Franchised
                agents to which I am signed. - Thanks for a great start Explore
                Talent!
